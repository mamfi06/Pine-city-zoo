                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>Lions are large, powerful carnivores known as the "king of the jungle," though they actually live in savannas and grasslands across sub-Saharan Africa (and a small population in Indiaâ€™s Gir Forest).</p>
                    <p>They are the only big cats that live in social groups, called prides, which usually consist of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males.</p>
                    <p>Male lions are easily recognized by their thick manes, which vary in color and size and can signal health and strength.</p>
                    <p>Females (lionesses) do most of the hunting, working together to catch prey such as antelope, zebras, and buffalo.</p>
                    <p>Lions are apex predators, but they also scavenge and steal kills from other animals.</p>
                    <p>Lions rest for up to 20 hours a day, becoming active mainly in the evening and early morning.</p>
                    <p>They communicate through roars, scent marking, facial expressions, and body language. </p>
                    <p>A lions roar can be heard up to 5 miles away and is used to warn rivals and locate pride members.</p>
                    <p>Lions face threats from habitat loss, human conflict, and poaching, and their populations are in decline in the wild.</p>
