                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials native to eastern Australia, known for their round, fuzzy appearance, large ears, and spoon-shaped noses. </p>
                    <p>Despite often being called “koala bears,” they are not bears, but marsupials, meaning they carry and raise their young in a pouch. </p>
                    <p>Koalas live in eucalyptus forests and feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and slightly toxic—koalas have a special digestive system to handle them.</p>
                    <p>Because of this low-energy diet, koalas sleep or rest for up to 18 to 22 hours a day to conserve energy. They are mostly solitary animals and are territorial, with males marking their trees using scent glands on their chests. Koalas have strong limbs and sharp claws that help them climb and grip tree branches.</p>
                    <p>A baby koala, called a joey, stays in its mothers pouch for about six months and continues to ride on her back until it's more independent.</p>
                    <p>Sadly, koalas face threats from habitat destruction, bushfires, disease (like chlamydia), and climate change, which have led to population declines.</p>
