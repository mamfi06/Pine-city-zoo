                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are large, black-and-white bears native to the mountain forests of central China, particularly in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. </p>
                    <p>They are famous for their distinctive appearance—black patches around their eyes, ears, and limbs—and for being gentle and solitary animals. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas eat almost exclusively bamboo, which makes up over 99% of their diet.</p>
                    <p>Because bamboo is low in nutrients, pandas spend around 10 to 16 hours a day eating and may consume up to 40 pounds of it daily.</p>
                    <p>Pandas live alone, except during mating season or when a mother is raising her cub. A panda cub is born very small, blind, and hairless, and stays with its mother for over a year. </p>
                    <p>Although pandas are strong climbers and swimmers, they mostly stay on the ground in bamboo forests.</p>
                    <p>They have a false thumb—an enlarged wrist bone—that helps them grasp bamboo stalks.</p>
                    <p>Once considered endangered, the giant panda's conservation status has improved to "vulnerable" due to extensive conservation efforts, including protected reserves and breeding programs.</p>
