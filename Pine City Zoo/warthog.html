                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family found in the grasslands, savannas, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
                    <p>They are easily recognized by their large heads, curved tusks, and warty bumps on their faces, which are actually thick growths of skin used for protection during fights.</p>
                    <p>Both males and females have tusks, but the males are usually larger and more curved.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs are herbivores, feeding mainly on grasses, roots, berries, and bark, though they will sometimes eat insects or carrion.</p>
                    <p>They often kneel on their front legs while grazing, using tough pads on their knees. Warthogs live in burrows, often taking over abandoned aardvark holes. </p>
                    <p>When entering, they back in to face outwardâ€”ready to defend themselves if necessary.</p>
                    <p>Although they look fierce, warthogs are usually shy and will run away quickly from predators, often with their tails sticking straight up as a signal to others.</p>
                    <p>They can run up to 30 miles per hour. Warthogs are also known for their toughness and can survive in harsh, dry environments with little water.</p>
