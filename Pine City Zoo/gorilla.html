                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest primates on Earth and are known for their strength, intelligence, and close genetic relationship to humansâ€”they share about 98% of their DNA with us.</p>
                    <p>Native to the forests of Central Africa, gorillas live in two main species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, each with its own subspecies, such as the mountain gorilla and lowland gorilla.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo. They live in social groups called troops or bands, usually led by a dominant silverback male, named for the patch of silver hair on his back.</p>
                    <p>Silverbacks protect the group, make decisions, and settle disputes. Despite their size and power, gorillas are generally gentle and peaceful, only showing aggression when threatened.</p>
                    <p>They are mostly ground-dwelling and move around by knuckle-walking. Gorillas build nests out of leaves and branches each night to sleep in, and they rarely drink water directly because their plant-based diet provides most of the moisture they need. </p>
                    <p>Gorillas are highly intelligent, capable of using tools, solving problems, and even learning elements of sign language in captivity.</p>
