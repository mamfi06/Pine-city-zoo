                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok, also known as the oryx, is a large antelope native to arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. </p>
                    <p>It has a striking appearance with long, straight horns (up to 4 feet long in both males and females), a grayish-tan body, black-and-white facial markings, and black stripes on its legs and flanks.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok are well adapted to dry environmentsâ€”they can survive without water for long periods, getting moisture from the plants they eat.</p>
                    <p>They're also powerful animals, capable of defending themselves against predators like lions using their sharp horns.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok live in herds and are active mostly during the cooler parts of the day.</p>
