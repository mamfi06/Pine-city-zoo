                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent and social animals that belong to the primate order. They are divided into two main groups: Old World monkeys, found in Africa and Asia (like baboons and macaques), and New World monkeys, found in Central and South America (like capuchins and howler monkeys).</p>
                    <p>Most monkeys live in tropical forests, though some, like baboons, live in savannas or mountainous areas. They are generally arboreal (tree-dwelling), but some species spend much of their time on the ground.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys have grasping hands and feet with opposable thumbs, making them excellent climbers. Many New World monkeys have prehensile tails, which act like an extra limb for gripping branches. </p>
                    <p>They are omnivorous, eating fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and sometimes small animals or bird eggs. Monkeys are very social, living in groups called troops that can range from a few individuals to over a hundred, depending on the species. </p>
                    <p>They communicate using a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language, and they often form strong social bonds through grooming and play.</p>
