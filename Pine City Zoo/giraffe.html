                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, with adult males reaching heights up to 18 feet. Their long necks, which can be over 6 feet long, help them reach leaves high up in trees, especially acacia trees.</p>
                    <p>Despite their height, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humansâ€”seven.</p>
                    <p>They have excellent eyesight and can spot predators from far distances. Giraffes live in Africa, often in savannas and open woodlands, and they move in loose herds. </p>
                    <p>Their distinctive coat patterns are unique to each individual, much like human fingerprints. Giraffes only need to drink water occasionally, as they get most of their moisture from the plants they eat </p>
