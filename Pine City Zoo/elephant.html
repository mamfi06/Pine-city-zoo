                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth, with three main species: the African savanna elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. </p>
                    <p>Known for their intelligence, elephants have large brains and are capable of problem-solving, learning, and memory retention. They are also highly emotional animals, forming deep social bonds, showing empathy, and even mourning their dead.</p>
                    <p>Communication among elephants is complex. They use vocalizations, body language, and even low-frequency infrasound that can travel several kilometers.</p>
                    <p>Remarkably, they can also detect seismic signals through the ground using their sensitive feet. As herbivores, elephants consume up to 300 pounds (135 kilograms) of vegetation daily, including grasses, fruits, bark, and roots. They inhabit a wide range of environments across Africa and Asia, such as savannas, forests, deserts, and marshes.</p>
                    <p>Two of their most distinctive features are their tusks and trunks. Tusks, which are actually elongated incisors made of ivory, are used for digging, lifting, and defense.</p>
                    <p>Elephants have the longest gestation period of any land animal—approximately 22 months—and they can live up to 60 to 70 years in the wild. </p>
                    <p> Despite their strength and intelligence, elephants face significant threats. Habitat destruction, human conflict, and poaching for ivory have led to a decline in populations.</p>
